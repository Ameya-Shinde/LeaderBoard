## JavaScript Functionality Used

This project utilizes several key JavaScript features and functionality to provide its core functionality:

- **Event Listeners**: JavaScript event listeners are used to capture user interactions, such as button clicks, to trigger actions like adding players and modifying scores.

- **DOM Manipulation**: The Document Object Model (DOM) is manipulated to dynamically create and update player entries on the scoreboard, as well as to perform actions like sorting and deleting players.

- **Array Sorting**: JavaScript's array sorting capabilities are employed to arrange the players on the scoreboard in descending order based on their scores.

- **Date and Time Generation**: A JavaScript function generates the current date and time, which is displayed alongside player entries when they are added to the scoreboard.

- **Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements are used to handle different button actions, including score modification and player deletion, based on user input.

- **String Interpolation**: Template literals (`  `) are used for string interpolation to create structured HTML elements with dynamic content, such as player names and timestamps.

These JavaScript functionalities come together to create a responsive and interactive score tracking application.
